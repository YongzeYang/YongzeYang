Hi, I'm Yongze, a sophomore student of [NPU](https://www.nwpu.edu.cn/), major in software engineering. 

I will upload my programming related course major assignments and markdown notes to [GitHub](https://github.com/YongzeYang).

*Currently, I am looking for an internship opportunity in mainland China.*

You can contact me via yongze_yang@outlook.com or yongze_yang@mail.nwpu.edu.cn.
