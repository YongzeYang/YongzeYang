Hi, I'm Yongze, a sophomore student of [NPU](https://www.nwpu.edu.cn/), major in software engineering. 

I will upload my major assignments of programming related courses and notes in .markdown file to [GitHub](https://github.com/YongzeYang).

*Currently, I am looking for an internship opportunity in mainland China.*
