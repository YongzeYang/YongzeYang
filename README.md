Hi, I'm YANG Yongze, an MSc student from [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/) (CS Department). In July 2023 I got my Bachelor of Engineering in Software Engineering from [Northwestern Polytechnical University](https://www.nwpu.edu.cn/).

Previously (from Mar 2024 to May 2024), I was an intern at [Hong Kong Institute of Science & Innovation, Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.cair-cas.org.hk/), focusing on ultrasound data processing and analysis.

Currently, I am looking for job opportunities located in Hong Kong. I will be graduating with an [Master of Science in Electronic Commerce](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/pg/programme/p17) degree in October and getting my [IANG visa](https://www.immd.gov.hk/eng/services/visas/IANG.html) afterwards.

You can contact me via yongze_yang@outlook.com (personal).
